An angle of 360 degrees creates a circle. Check out this example:" %}<br><br>

Speed only allows one argument: number of moves per second. <br><i><b> speed Infinity </i></b> sets the animation time to zero, which means turtle motion occurs immediately, as soon as you run it (as long as there is nothing else already ahead of it in the queue)." %}<br><br>

It'll also paint 2 dots (using <i><b> label </b></i>) to simulate the snake's eyes. As you can see, before calling to the fuction, the turtle is turned 45ยบ to the right and speeded up to 100 moves per sec." %} <br><br>

The mathematical coordinate axes are used, placing (0, 0) at the middle with x increasing to the right and y increasing upward." %}<br><br>
